node-paperclip-mongoose
=========

For now I'm moving this back into the main repo because it is annoying to make changes to all the different modules and then reinstall and then test.  I plan to eventually make it separate, but for now, this module is unnecessary.

This is going to be the module that people need if they use mongoose.  It won't work until the next version of node-paperclip is released, but I am publishing it in order to test it to ensure that when I do publish it it will work as expected.  The configuration has changed and also the form that you would use to upload a document has also changed.


To install 

```bash
npm install node-paperclip --save
npm install node-paperclip-mongoose --save
```

Here is an example of a model that uses the mongoose plugin.

```javascript
const mongoose     = require('mongoose');
const Schema       = mongoose.Schema;
const Paperclip    = require('node-paperclip');

const ProfileImage = new Schema({
  user_id: { type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' },
  username: String
});

ProfileImage.plugin(Paperclip.plugins.load('mongoose'), {
  profile_image: {
    avatar: { 
      styles: [
        { original: true },
        { tiny:     { width: 50,  height: 50,  modifier: '#' } },
        { thumb:    { width: 100, height: 100, modifier: '#' } },
        { profile:  { width: 200, height: 200, modifier: '#' } }
      ],
      prefix:      '{{plural}}/{{document.username}}',
      name_format: '{{style}}.{{extension}}'
    }
  }
})

module.exports     = mongoose.model('ProfileImage', ProfileImage);
```

Here is an example of an express route that uses that ProfileImage model.
```javascript

var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
var ProfileImage = require('profile_image');

// if node-paperclip is a dependency of this module is it possible to load it 
// separately like this as middleware? Or do I need to have it installed explicitly
// Something you wouldn't know unless you have published modules that depend on 
// each other.

var middleware = require('node-paperclip').middleware

router.post('/post_profile_image',

    middleware.parse({verbose_methods: true}),

  function(req, res, next) {
    req.body.profile_image.user_id  = req.user._id;
    req.body.profile_image.username = req.user.username;
    next();
  },

  function(req, res, next) {

    console.log(req.body);


    ProfileImage.findOne({username: req.user.username}, function(err, profile_image) {
      if (req.body.profile_image) {
        if (profile_image) {
          profile_image.remove(function(err) {
            next();
          });
        } else {
          next();
        }
      } else {
        res.redirect('/#profile/images');
      }
    });
  },

  function (req, res) {
    ProfileImage.create(req.body.profile_image, function(err, doc) {
      res.redirect('/#profile/images');
    });
})


module.exports = router;
```

And then use the same name as you put in the as the key in the plugin and the name of the attachment that you configured (profile_image[avatar] using the example above)  and the middleware should correctly prepare the data to be saved and place the file in the correct place in your storage.

```html
<form  class="form-horizontal" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="/post_profile_image" method="post">

<h1>Edit Profile Image</h1>

<div  class="form-group">
  <div>  
    <label>Profile Image:</label>
    <input type="file" name="profile_image[avatar]" id="profile_image">
  </div>
</div>

<div  class="form-group">
  <div class="col-sm-offset-2 col-sm-10">
    <input class='btn btn-default' type="submit" value="Save"/>
  </div>
</div>

</form>

```



This module now uses the file system by default, but can use s3 or whatever cloud api you want, just right a module like the node-paperclip-s3 module.  If you share your code that would be great, but you can just pass an object or function that has the correct api and the paperclip module will use what is in the configuration.  I'll make a few examples to show how that should work soon.  The example above is configured to use the file system.  

If you plan to use s3 you will need the following environment variables set the AWS_BUCKET, AWS_REGION, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
